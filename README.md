## Description
This project is a plugin for websites that make use of the WordPress application.
When active, this plugin replaces all instances of the text "[SnakeGame]" (without quotes)
in web pages with a 575px wide and 598px high canvas styled in accordance with
the included CSS stylesheet. This canvas displays an implementation of the popular 1970s
arcade game Snake (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game))

The game is started with the spacebar and the snake is controlled using the arrow keys.
The object of the game is to eat blue squares while not crashing into the wall or the
snake's own body.

## Installation
To install the plugin, upload and extract the rdouglascanada-wp-snake.zip file to your
WordPress plugins directory.
